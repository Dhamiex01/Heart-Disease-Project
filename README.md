# Heart-Disease-Project

## Overview
The ipynb file provides an overview of the heart disease prediction model developed using a Decision Tree Classifier. The objective of this lroject is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health parameters. The Decision Tree Classifier was chosen for its interpretability and effectiveness in handling both numerical and categorical data.

## Dataset Used
The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease dataset, which includes various attributes related to patient health, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a patient, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling the dataset in DataFrame format.
- **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **Seaborn**: Employed for data visualization, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for plotting graphs and visualizing data in various forms.
- **Scikit-learn**: A powerful library for machine learning that provides tools for model training, evaluation, and selection.

## Conclusion
The model demonstrates the ability to predict heart disease based on various health metrics. Future work may include improving model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning, exploring additional features, or integrating more complex algorithms.
